# Gradio Image Pixel Value Recognizer

This is a simple Python program that uses the Gradio library to create a web interface for recognizing pixel values in an uploaded image. Users can upload an image, and the program will display the pixel values for the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels of the image.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Gradio
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install gradio opencv-python-headless numpy

Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Run the program:

Program Details
The process_image function processes the uploaded image.
It reads the image using OpenCV, checks if it's grayscale, and then extracts pixel values for specific points.
